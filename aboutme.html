    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>My name is Santiago Botero, and you have stumbled upon my thesis project presented for a bachelors degree in geographic information systems. I wanted to build an old school html website to show how easy it can 
      be for anyone to convey their message to others and display their findings and methods. If you would like to know more about my thesis, access a copy, or just connect feel free to reach me at santiago.botero.roa@gmail.com. I also 
      enjoy prototyping with microcontrollers such as Arduinos and Raspberry Pi's. Currently also interested in the environmental applications of blockchain technologies, decentralized finance, environmental policy, and nature finance.
