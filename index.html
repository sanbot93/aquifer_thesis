  <h1> Welcome to the AquiWeb Tool!</h1>
  <h2> What Is This Page All About?</h2>
  <p> Through this website I hope to explore how human use of spaces alters the dynamics of natural processes, through habitat destruction, 
    careless resource depletion and extraction, or changes to the hydrological cycle. 
    This research is the first phase in a 3-phase project to improve our understanding of how land 
    use choices and climate change are affecting aquifer recharge within the Columbia Basin. 
    Focusing our research on using aquifer recharge potential mapping,  which is a process of using 
    different spatial and statistical tools to identify areas where the interaction between slope, precipitation, 
    aquifer geology, soil permeability, and land use are used to derive various aquifer recharge potentials (very poor, poor, moderate, good, and very good). 
    Furthermore, I used a multicriteria decision making process known as the Analytical Hierarchical Process, which allowed for pair-wise comparisons between the variables mentioned. 
    The resulting analysis showed that of the studied aquifers, 57% had moderate recharge potential, 24% fell under poor, and 17% under good. Through our results, we hoped to better 
    understand the current state of aquifer recharge within the Columbia Basin, and the implications that these bring in the face of human pressures through industrial and domestic use, as well as climate change. </p>
